## What is this plugin?
Bunnies is a Dalamud plugin for FFXIV which provides QoL and automation for completing the Bunny Fate and finding the coffer afterwards.

## What do I need to run Bunnies?
First, you must use the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) to run your game. The Quick Launcher allows for custom plugins to be installed to add new functionality to the game. To install, you first need to have the Quick Launcher setup for your game, instructions can be found on the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) page.

## How do I install this plugin?

## How to use this plugin?
In the in-game chat, type and enter `/bunnies`, this will bring up the main window for the plugin.

Under the "Start Bunnies" tab in the main window, you can select which zone you want to enter and run the Bunny Fate in. (NOTE: Pyros is currently the only available zone, as others are WIP!)
This will automatically take you to the Eureka zone selected, if you do not have this zone unlocked, you will be notified accordingly.
